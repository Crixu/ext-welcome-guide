Ever felt left after you completed the installation of your first Plesk Server?
Thanks to Elvis this time is now over. Our mascot will Guide you through the most important steps before he hands you over to our Advisor. 

## Presets

The Plesk Welcome Guide features 3 different presets:

Own presets can be easily configured via the backend of the extension or through your own JSON file. Use the cli commands to easily download and activate your own presets for your customers.
